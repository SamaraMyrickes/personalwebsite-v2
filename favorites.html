                    <p>Baby (Jennifer Grey) is one listless summer away from the Peace Corps.

Her luck turns around, however, when the resort's dance instructor, Johnny (Patrick Swayze), enlists Baby as his new partner, and the two fall in love. Baby's father forbids her from seeing Johnny, but she's determined to help him perform the last big dance of the summer.

            <h3>American Horror Story</h3>
            
            <p>"American Horror Story" was created by the co-creators of "Glee," but the shows have little in common besides that. The show revolves around the Harmons, a family of three, who move from Boston to Los Angeles in order to reconcile past anguish. What the Harmons don't know is that the house they've moved into is haunted. But it's not haunted by Casperesque friendly ghosts -- it's haunted by demonic creatures. The creatures have a history of not only spooking the house's residents but also devouring them. After living in this house, family patriarch and psychiatrist, Ben, may need a shrink of his own.</p>

                <h3>Law & Order:Special Victims Unit</h3>
                
                <p>Detectives who are part of the NYPD's Special Victims Unit investigate crimes against the vulnerable. While the focus of other shows in the "Law & Order" franchise is primarily on murder cases, the SVU detectives frequently deal with rape and assault, in which a survivor assists with the investigation. The series cast of veteran actors includes Mariska Hargitay and rapper Ice-T, and occasional crossover episodes feature detectives from other series including editions of the "Law & Order" franchise and as well as "Chicago PD," another series from the mind of executive producer Dick Wolf.
