      <h2>Thoughts On Leadership</h2>
      <p> To me, leadership means being a role model to others showing inspiration and guiding others in the right direction. A leader steps up in times of crisis, and is able to think and act creatively in difficult situations. Unlike management, leadership cannot be taught, although it may be learned and enhanced through coaching or mentoring.
